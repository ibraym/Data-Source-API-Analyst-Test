# Authenticating to the GitHub REST API

[GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28) requires authentication for accessing many endpoints, retrieving enhanced data, and increasing rate limits. Authentication is handled through various token-based methods, each tailored to specific use cases. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the available authentication methods, their usage, and related considerations.:

## 1. **General Authentication Guidelines**
API endpoints require authentication tokens to grant access or to provide additional features. Tokens should be sent in the `Authorization` header. Common formats are:
   - `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`
   - `Authorization: token TOKEN`

>If using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), `Bearer` must be used.

Accessing endpoints without authentication or with insufficient permissions can result in:
    - `404 Not Found` for endpoints requiring authentication.
    - `403 Forbidden` for endpoints where token permissions are inadequate.
    - `401 Unauthorized` for invalid credentials.

>Repeated invalid attempts may trigger temporary authentication lockouts, leading to `403 Forbidden` errors across all requests. more details in [Rate limits](./rate-limits.md)


## 2. **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**
Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are ideal for individual usage of the API. They can be:
   - **Fine-grained tokens** (recommended): It provides granular control over token permissions and requires specific permissions tailored to each API endpoint.
   - **Classic tokens**: It uses broader "scopes" to define access, such as repo for repository access or user for user data.

## 3. **Tokens from GitHub Apps**
Tokens Generated by GitHub Apps are ideal for organizational or multi-user access. Tokens are tied to the app, not users, and permissions are defined during app setup. GitHub Apps are recommended for API authentication over OAuth.

## 4. **GitHub Actions**
For workflows running on GitHub Actions, the recommended approach is to use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API requests.

## 5. **Deprecated Method: Username and Password**
GitHub no longer supports basic authentication with usernames and passwords. Attempts to authenticate this way will result in 4xx errors. Always use token-based authentication for API access.

## 6. **Recommendations**
   - Use the authentication method most suitable for your use case:
       - Individual Use: Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens.
       - Apps or Organizations: GitHub App tokens.
       - GitHub Actions: GITHUB_TOKEN or custom secrets.
   - Regularly rotate tokens and review permissions to maintain security.
   - Monitor rate limits and errors to adjust token usage and permissions as needed.
